/*

When an exception is thrown, the exception-handling system looks through the "nearest" handlers in the order they are written. 
When it finds a match, the exception is considered handled, and no further searching occurs.

Matching an exception doesn't require a perfect match between the exception and its handler.
A derived-class object will match a handler for the base class, 

If you try to "mask" the derived-class exceptions by putting the base-class catch clause first
the compiler will give you an error message
