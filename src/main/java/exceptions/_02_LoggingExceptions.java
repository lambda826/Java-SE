/**
 * The static Logger.getLogger() method creates a Logger object associated with the String argument (usually the name of the package and class that the errors are about) which sends its output to System.err.
 * The easiest way to write to a Logger is just to call the method associated with the level of logging message; here, severe() is used.
 * To produce the String for the logging message, we’d like to have the stack trace where the exception is thrown, but printStackTrace() doesn’t produce a String by default.
 * To get a String, we need to use the overloaded printStackTrace() that takes a java.io.PrintWriter object as an argument (all of this will be fully explained in the I/O chapter).
 * If we hand the Print Writer constructor a java.io.StringWriter object, the output can be extracted as a String by calling toString().
