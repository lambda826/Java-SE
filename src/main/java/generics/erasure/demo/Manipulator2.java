/*
 * In order to call f(), we must assist the generic class by giving it a bound that tells the compiler to only accept types that conform to that bound
 * We say that a generic type parameter erases to its first bound (itâ€™s possible to have multiple bounds).
 * We also talk about the erasure of the type parameter.
 * The compiler actually replaces the type parameter with its erasure, so in the above case, T erases to HasF, which is the same as replacing T with HasF in the class body
